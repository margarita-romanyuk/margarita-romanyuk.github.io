                        Dear Sir/Madam,
                        I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Quality Assurance Engineer Internship position for 2024.  It would be a great opportunity for me to join a dynamic and inclusive organization that prioritizes employee growth and development and where diversity and equity are the main value.  With a strong passion for building a career in Software Testing, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to making Company’s Clients life brighter and healthier, and further develop my skills and potential in this environment.
                        Having reviewed the responsibilities and requirements outlined for this role, I believe my background quite align with your expectations. I am eager to join the QA team and contribute to the success of your company.  I’m interested in building and honing my test engineering skills.  I am also excited about the prospect of joining a company that is committed to giving back to the local community.
                        Originally, I am from Ukraine, I was compelled to relocate to Ireland in April 2022 due to the ongoing conflict in my home country and I’ve been living in Tramore from April 2022.  In Ukraine I worked as a head of planning and operations, City Tram and Trolley Network, so this role honed my analytical, problem – solving and resilience skills.  My passion for IT dates back to 2015, and I have actively pursued this interest by enrolling in several QA courses in Ukraine and studying by myself. I am familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, and mySQL languages. I have an understanding of the Agile lifecycle, testing methodologies, and the importance of documentation.  In terms of language skills, I am currently at an English proficiency level of 4, and I am committed to further improving my English language skills, currently studying at level 5 through the ESOL program.  Attention to detail is one of my core strengths, stemming from my natural inclination as a perfectionist. I believe that the small details matter greatly in the world of quality assurance and IT.  I am a good team player and kind – hearted person, and I am always ready and willing to offer assistance and support to my colleagues, as I believe that collaboration is key to achieving success in any field. Besides I’m a firm believer in continuous improvement, as I have two degrees and did many courses, and I am currently enrolled in college and attending English classes to further enhance my skills and knowledge.
                        Thank you for considering my application.  I am excited about the prospect of joining Sun Life.  
                        Sincerely,
                        Margarita.
